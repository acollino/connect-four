This browser-based game recreates the classic children's game of the same name, where two players take turns to match four of their pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally!

This was created using Springboard's provided basic framework, updated in VSCode on WSL. The CSS features keyframe animations for the dropping pieces, z-indexed images to allow pieces to "fall" behind the game grid, and inset box-shadows to provide a sense of depth. Highlights of the Javascript include utilizing arrow functions, destructuring to provide a default value for an argument, and data-attributes to track board position, as well as satisfying Springboard's given requirements.

Feel free to give it a try!
